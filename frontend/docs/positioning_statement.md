# Sābhya AI: Positioning Statement

**What makes Sābhya AI different from a normal LLM UI?**

Sābhya AI is a **Governance Console**, not a chat interface. Unlike standard LLM clients that prioritize speed and fluidity, Sābhya strictly enforces a **"Trust but Verify"** architecture where transport success (`200 OK`) is never treated as governance success. It implements **infinite patience**, refusing to display content—no matter how fast it arrives—until a cryptographic audit log confirms compliance. By decoupling user interaction from system trust and enforcing **Audit Supremacy** (where governance signals override content payload), Sābhya transforms the frontend from a passive display into an active enforcement layer for zero-trust environments.
